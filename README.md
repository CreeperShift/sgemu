# SGEmu

SGEmu is a Shattered Galaxy server emulator by ThreeSix.

#### Requirements

Go Lang - for code compliation
MongoDB - for the server database

#### Getting started (Linux)

Download the `build.sh` script and execute it in order to download the source code and build the binaries.

This will create a Go path in your home directory - `$HOME/go` and checkout the code.

Binaries will be created at `$HOME/sgemu`

Packaging of additional files required by each binary hasn't been implemented yet.

**TODO: Improve this and add documentation for initial server setup**
